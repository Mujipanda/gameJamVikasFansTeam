Bomb it Up!

~ Blurb ~

It's 2053, the world is at war. You are operators inside the USS Hypoxia, the newly launched nuclear-powered submarine. Plans for its launch have been leaked and the sub is under attack by an enemy vessel underneath, deep in the ocean trenches.
It is down to you to save your ship and crew by controlling a destructive bomb remotely. You need to dodge the countermeasures fired by the enemy and use the special EMP at the right time. You have one shot so make it count.
